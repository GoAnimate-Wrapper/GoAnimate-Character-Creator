# GoAnimate Character Creator
Source code from several legacy Flash versions of Vyond's character creator.  I have decided to not rely on a single`.swf` to decompile on the basis of practicality; older versions of a Flash app may be used for compatibility purposes.  **You can access those versions and access their source code on the [releases section](https://github.com/Windows81/GoAnimate-Character-Creator/releases).**

*Note:* this project has been decompied using [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version11.2.0), the inner-workings of which I have no knowlegde of.  If you're interested in modifying this repo's code and re-compiling it, I'd recommend using the same program.
