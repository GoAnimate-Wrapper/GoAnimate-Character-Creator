# GoAnimate Character Creator
Source code from several legacy Flash versions of Vyond's character creator.  I have decided to not rely on a single`.swf` to decompile on the basis of practicality; older versions of a Flash app may be used for compatibility purposes.  **You can access those versions and access their source code on the [releases section](https://github.com/Windows81/GoAnimate-Character-Creator/releases).**

*Note:* this project has been decompied using [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version11.2.0), the inner-workings of which I have no knowlegde of.  If you're interested in modifying this repo's code and re-compiling it, I'd recommend using the same program.

It is also worth noting that the results produced here are NOT able to be recompiled. While this can be used to gain a better understanding of the Legacy Video Maker, the ActionScript decompilation/fla conversion provided by JPEXS is not nearly close enough for recompilation to be possible. This repo may, and most likely will, contain errors and inaccuracies within the provided code.
